- To enter a category name in the CarConfig you have to double click on `Add Category` (here in my picture it is already called SedanCars because I gave the category a name)
- Left-click in the `Car Config` to select the Config you want to add vehicles. Then double-click on the vehicle in the list of `Unique Name` to add it to the selected Car Config.

- Navigate to the folder where you want to have the .json files and click on `Select folder`. The files will now created in that folder.
- Do the same with Export Car Config.

- #### I advise you to import both before editing PriceItems and CarConfigs to avoid errors later on.
