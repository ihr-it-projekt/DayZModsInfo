## Description

Do you know the problem. You have a lot of cool mods but they bring duplicate Items in? And the items are not compatible to use in each other mod? Here is the solution. Just let player exchange the Items.
When ever a player has a configured item in hand, he will get an action to exchange the item to another one.
