## Calculation example for poo or pee

### Formula
```text
incrementalPerTick = 100 Percent / howLongItShouldTakeToBeFull * tickLengthInMinutes

// example for 60 minutes
pooIncreaseFactorPerTick = 100 Percent / 60 minutes * tickLengthInMinutes
1,67 = 100 / 60 * 1


or

// example for 120 minutes
peeIncreaseFactorPerTick = 100 percent  / 120 minutes * tickLengthInMinutes
0,83 = 100 / 120 * 1

// example for 300 minutes
peeIncreaseFactorPerTick = 100 percent  / 300 minutes * tickLengthInMinutes
0,33 = 100 / 300 * 1

```
